        <p>The Probe Data application is a Core java based application that processes GPS data received
          from cell phone service providers to analyze missing road geometries to eventually help
          enhance Nokia road network products. It has a Hadoop cluster and associated Map Reduce
          programs to apply algorithms on GPS Data to learn about driving patterns on new roads.
          It also has, a series of core java components to create potential road images i.e. clusters
          based on GPS points. Apart from these two main components, it also has a single web
          application for
          report generation, and a desktop application (C#) for viewing missing roads and a
          crowdsourcing framework for reviewing road networks maps.
          These components relies on Hadoop, JMS using QPid, core java, spring framework, hibernate
          and JDBC, and PLSQL.</p>
