        <p>Sears Holdings Corporation has multiple high transactional volume Ecommerce websites such as sears.com, kmart.com, kenmore.com, craftsman.com as well as others. All the websites share a complex distributed architecture using state of art technologies involving relational as well as NoSQL data storage platforms, load balanced JVMs running Java Web applications with Apache Web Server , MOD_JK and Apache Tomcat. The Product Detail Page (PDP) is an important page of the websites where customers actually view , learn, compare , decide and finally buy the product. The single page application (SPA) is built using HTML5, Backbone.js, Chaplin, Handlebar, Bootstrap, CoffeeScript and makes a series of AJAX calls to the backend PDP Service REST layer. The PDP Services REST application aggregates and accumulates information from other internal services such as Dynamic Page Template service, Product Content Service, Fulfillment Services(Delivery, Shipping, Store Pick UP), Ecoupon Services, Promotion Service, Rebates Service, Add To Cart Service, among others. The Dynamic Page Template service is unique as it enables Sears to use the same front end SPA application JavaScript / CoffeeScript code to load pages that look very different to the users of the different web sites. During non peak time, the cluster receives 50,000 calls per second on an average, while during the Thanksgiving weekend, the peak load routinely goes above 75,000 calls per second. Due to Sears robust load testing effort all throughout the year, on several occasions in a typical month, there is SOASTA testing that tests the website in level 1 through level 4 as well.  Besides, this application, the PDP Services team also develops and maintains two other REST APIs such as the Auto Fitment services application (used by Auto Parts products) as well as Browse Services which are used by the Product Listing Page (PLP).</p>
